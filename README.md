<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a basic game called word beater. The users goal is to write the word that is randomly picked from an array of words within the time specified. 
If the user writes the word before the timer, the timer will reset and they will gain a point. 
If the user fails to write the word before the clock runs out the game stops and game over is displayed reseting the score and time.
